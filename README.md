README
======

This is just an app I'm writing to track my expenses using

1. Slick
2. Spray
3. Akka (maybe?)

It's mostly a learning exercise but I hope to write about my learnings 
about design, build etc. The backend will be written as rest API's. An angular
web client will shortly follow to make it easy to use.
